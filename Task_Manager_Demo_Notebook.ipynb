    "Welcome to Task Manager 1.0\n",

    "The objective of this project is to have a Terminal-runned or Jupyter Notebook based local task planning service, functionalities of this project include:\n",
    "- add/delete tasks\n",
    "- preview all tasks in list\n",
    "- view all tasks in detail\n",
    "- automatically save tasks (if there are tasks active before quitting Task Manager)\n",
    "- automatically re-open tasks from previous sessions (if it exists)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- To run this program in Jupyter Notebook: Import the program and call the \"demo\" function from script.py as belows.\n",
    "- To run this program in Terminal, make sure Python 3 is installed. Head to folder program_script and run: \"Python3 script\" (preferred method)"

    "### Caution: Variation between using Jupyter Notebook and Terminal\n",
    "1. By calling \"Python3 script.py\" in terminal/command prompt, it will initiate automiatically because \"__name__ == __main__\". In Jupyter Notebook, to run the program, first you need to import the script, then call the demo(...) function to run the same function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Because this Jupyter Notebook and script.py is at the different directory, user needs to be aware of the location data is stored. For example:\n",
    "- When opening and saving the data, the program will nevigate up one directory level then store the file with default or assigned file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In program_script\\script.py, the data storing location is default to be in Task_Manager folder and be called data.md. Thus it is defaulted in function as demo(file_name = \"data.md\"). Which the program will go up one directory level to leave program_script folder and save file in Task_Manager folder instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "- However, since this notebook is not in the program_script folder, instead it is in the folder Task_Manager, the defaulted \"file_name\" value would make the program store data.md store it AT the location of where Task_Manager folder is located INSTEAD of being inside of Task_Manager\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thus, as above, we call the program by:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "TM.demo(\"Task_Manager\\data.md\")\n",
    "```\n",
